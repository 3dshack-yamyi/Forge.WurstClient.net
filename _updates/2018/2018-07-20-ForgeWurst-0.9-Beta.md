## Changelog

- ForgeWurst is now compatible with the ViveCraft mod, allowing you to hack Minecraft in virtual reality!

- Added a `.vrtweaks` command that automatically adjusts your settings to ensure compatibility with ViveCraft.

- Added a button to the inventory screen that opens the ClickGUI. Useful if you can't or don't want to use a keybind. Can be disabled in the UI settings.

- Added a "Max height" slider to the UI settings.

- Fixed `.help` listing commands in the wrong order.
