## Changelog

- Added AutoFish hack: Automatically catches fish using your best fishing rod. If it finds a better rod while fishing, it will automatically switch to it.

- Added MobSpawnESP hack: Highlights areas where mobs can spawn. A yellow cross indicates that mobs can spawn at night, while a red one means that mobs can spawn at any time. Similar to an unnamed feature in the NotEnoughItems mod, but this one has a much higher range due to more efficient rendering.

- Added support for nether warts to AutoFarm.

- Fixed a crash when using Nuker while being inside of a block.
