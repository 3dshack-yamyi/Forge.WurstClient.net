## Changelog

- Added X-Ray hack with customizable list of blocks.

  Unlike the X-Ray hack currently in Wurst, this one won't break redstone contraptions in singleplayer.

  Also, the list of blocks can be changed directly through the ClickGUI instead of being hidden in a separate options manager.

- Added Tracers option to PlayerESP, MobESP, ItemESP and ChestESP.
